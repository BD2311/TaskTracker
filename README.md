# TaskTracker
## About this Project:

### Project Proposal
#### Description
TaskTracker is a utility programmed in Java designed to automate the tracking of progress on tasks.
#### Features/Requirements/Outcome
- User will be able to create different types of tasks such as work task or personal task
- User will be able to add requirements to each task
- User will be able to check off requirements and system will automatically mark tasks as complete if all requirements are checked off
- User will be able to forcibly mark a task as complete even if a requirement is not fulfilled
- User will be able to add a new requirement to a task even if the task is complete which will move the task to be in progress
#### Project Time Management
Project will be worked on after class on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays

## Getting Started:

# Weekly Checkpoints

## Week 1

- [ ] Write the project proposal.
- [ ] Plan the object-oriented design, starting with CRC cards.  Determine classes (with fields and methods) and interfaces and their responsibilities. (The "model" part of MVC.)
- [ ] Create the UML.
- [ ] Begin writing project page.

## Week 2

- [ ] Write code for classes X, Y, Z.
- [ ] Develop test cases and test code as it is written.
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 3

- [ ] Finish writing classes.
- [ ] Determine where exception handling is needed to ensure the program fails gracefully.
- [ ] Design the GUI (sketch it out on paper) - include the design in the Weekly update!
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 4

- [ ] Test, test, test, debug, and test some more.
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 5

- [ ] Write code to create a non-functional GUI (the "view" part of MVC).
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 6

- [ ] Add event handling to make the GUI functional (the "controller" part of MVC).
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 7

- [ ] Test, test, test, debug, and test some more.
- [ ] Update project page with progress details.
- [ ] Submit code written so far.

## Week 8

- [ ] Debug any remaining problems.
- [ ] Create project demonstration video, including information about how each LO is used as part of the project.
- [ ] Submit final code on Canvas, and add videos to project page.
